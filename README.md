# cracked

Firecracker microVM control plane for a single EC2 host. Boots agent sandboxes
(Ubuntu + Chrome + desktop + Python) on demand, tracks capacity, and proxies
VNC and agent traffic to each VM.

Go 1.27, stdlib only, zero dependencies.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cmd/cracked` | entrypoint: sweep, serve, drain |
| `internal/vm` | lifecycle, slot allocator, firecracker config, teardown |
| `internal/fc` | firecracker API client over its unix socket |
| `internal/hostnet` | TAP devices and slot→IP/MAC derivation |
| `internal/api` | HTTP routes, bearer auth, WebSocket-capable proxy |
| `rootfs/` | guest image: Dockerfile, overlay-init, systemd units, agent |
| `scripts/` | `host-setup.sh` (once per host), `build-rootfs.sh` |
| `deploy/` | systemd unit for the control plane |

## Setup

The EC2 instance **must** have nested virtualization enabled — it is opt-in and
off by default:

```sh
aws ec2 run-instances --instance-type m7i.2xlarge \
    --cpu-options "NestedVirtualization=enabled" ...
# or, on an existing stopped instance:
aws ec2 modify-instance-cpu-options --instance-id <id> \
    --core-count 4 --threads-per-core 2 --nested-virtualization enabled
```

Then, on the host:

```sh
sudo scripts/host-setup.sh          # KVM gate, user, firewall, firecracker, kernel
scripts/build-rootfs.sh             # Docker -> shared read-only rootfs.ext4
make install                        # build and install /usr/local/bin/cracked
sudo install -m0644 deploy/cracked.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl edit cracked         # add Environment=CRACKED_TOKEN=<secret>
sudo systemctl enable --now cracked
```

## API

All routes except `GET /healthz` need the token, via `Authorization: Bearer`,
`?token=`, or the `cracked_token` cookie.

```sh
export H=http://localhost:8080 T=<token>
A() { curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" "$@"; }

A -X POST $H/vms -d '{"id":"alice"}'      # 201, blocks until the agent answers
A $H/vms                                   # list
A $H/vms/alice                             # one VM, state read live off firecracker
A -X POST $H/vms/alice/pause               # freeze
A -X POST $H/vms/alice/resume              # unfreeze
A -X DELETE "$H/vms/alice"                 # stop, KEEP the workspace
A -X DELETE "$H/vms/alice?purge=true"      # stop and delete the workspace
A $H/capacity                              # slot/vcpu/memory accounting
```

Capacity exhaustion returns **503** with `Retry-After: 30` and
`{"error":"capacity_exhausted","resource":"slots"}`.

VNC (open in a browser):

```
http://<host>:8080/vms/alice/vnc/vnc.html?path=vms/alice/vnc/websockify&token=<T>
```

The agent and the human share display `:0`, so takeover is instant.

## Storage model

- `images/rootfs.ext4` — one immutable image, opened **read-only by every VM at
  once**. The host page cache holds a single copy for all of them.
- `workspaces/{id}.ext4` — 5 GiB per VM, mounted as the **overlayfs upper
  layer**. Every guest write lands here: Chrome profile, Downloads,
  credentials, agent workspace. Survives `DELETE` unless `?purge=true`.
- `run/{id}/` — ephemeral; wiped by the startup sweep.

Delete a VM and recreate it with the same id to get its data back.

## Operational notes

- **Never `poweroff` inside a guest.** On x86 that stops the guest but leaves
  the firecracker process alive forever. Use `reboot` (the control plane's
  `SendCtrlAltDel` does this correctly).
- A control-plane restart **kills running VMs** but preserves every workspace.
  The startup sweep guarantees no orphan processes and no stray taps.
- Guests are firewalled off from IMDS (`169.254.0.0/16`), the VPC, each other,
  and the host itself. Verify after any firewall change:
  `curl -m 3 http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/` from inside a guest
  must time out.
- `MaxVMs` is 5 in `internal/vm/vm.go`. Raise to 6 only after confirming host
  memory headroom at steady state — swap is off, so overcommit means the OOM
  killer reaps a live VM.

## Development

Requires the Go 1.27 toolchain (`go.mod` pins it). Ubuntu's apt `golang` is
older than this — install from https://go.dev/dl/ on whatever box you build on.

```sh
make test    # unit tests
make vet
make build   # cross-compiles to bin/cracked for linux/amd64
```

`make build` cross-compiles, so you can build on a laptop and ship only the
binary to the host; the EC2 box needs no Go toolchain of its own.
